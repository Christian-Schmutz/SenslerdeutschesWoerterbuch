# Seislerd√ºtsches W√∂rterbuech

The goal of this project is to create a digital version of the popular book. It is not intended to replace the print version but rather to offer additional features and help to print future versions.

Ja, as weri passend √π witzig di ganzi Dokumentation √πf Seislerd√ºtsch z mache. Aber f«úr m√∂glichst offe z syy, isch Englisch aw√§ glych di besseri Wau. üòâ

## Quick start

After cloning the repository you need to create a `.env` file.

```
cp .env.defaults .env
```

You then have to set a password for the admin user of the Elasticsearch container. You can do this by uncommenting the last line in the new `.env` file and set a password for`ELASTIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>`.

That's it. Now you can run everything locally with Docker.

```
docker compose up elasticsearch proxy backend
```

The first time it might take a few minutes to download all the images. After everything is up and running you need to initially setup the words in the elastic container by calling `http://localhost:8001/elastic-reset`.

After that you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4202`.

## Contributing

Every contribution to the project is more than welcome! You can submit bugs or feature requests, or even contribute code. Everything is tracked as issue on the repository. Feel free to read through them and create your own.

If you want to start coding, you can find more information in the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING-STARTED.md).

If you have any questions, please use Issues to ask them.

## Deploying

Important: For now the target infrastructure is not available. This is why we currently only do manual deployments. If
you really want to deploy, create an issue to ask for permissions.

Build and push images to Azure Container Registry

```
az acr login --name seislerwoerterbuech

docker build -t seislerwoerterbuech.azurecr.io/elasticsearch:latest -f docker/elasticsearch/Dockerfile .
docker build -t seislerwoerterbuech.azurecr.io/backend:latest -f docker/backend/Dockerfile .
docker build -t seislerwoerterbuech.azurecr.io/proxy:latest -f docker/proxy/Dockerfile .

docker push seislerwoerterbuech.azurecr.io/elasticsearch:latest
docker push seislerwoerterbuech.azurecr.io/backend:latest
docker push seislerwoerterbuech.azurecr.io/proxy:latest
```

Then update the Container App

```
az containerapp update \
  --resource-group senslerdeutsches-woerterbuch \
  --name senslerdeutsches-woerterbuch \
  --yaml containerapp-deploy.yaml
```
